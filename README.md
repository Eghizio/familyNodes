familyNodes (Vanilla JavaScript)

Today while I was casualy scrolling through the Facebook feed I've came across the video. The video about Sir Nicholas Winton.

To be honest I have already seen that video at least once. But this time I came to a conclusion, that if he saved nearly 700 people lives, how did that affect the world. He made an impact upon 700 people lives that impacted another human beeings therefore affecting more and more people in total. 

So as you might already know we are heading towards the idea of "Six degrees of seperation".

I'm creating this tool to check and simulate different outcomes of corelation between people. My cousin has recently been doing a genealogical tree of our family so I could implement the data of my family here :)

Anyways I'll try to work on it for a little trying using clean Vanilla JS using ES6 standards and trying to divide each piece of code I can to keep it as clean and simple to read as I can. An excercise for DRY and KISS princples :)
